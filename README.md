# Academic-Year-Progression-System

2021/22 Course Work

A program to predict progression outcomes at the end of each academic year at the University.

The program should allow students to predict their progression outcome at the end of each academic year. The program should prompt for the number of credits at pass, defer and fail and then display the appropriate progression outcome for an individual student (i.e., progress, trailing, module retriever or exclude).

Validation

• The program should display ‘Integer required’ if a credit input is the wrong data type.

• The program should display ‘Out of range’ if credits entered are not in the range 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120.

• The program should display ‘Total incorrect’ if the total of the pass, defer and fail credits is not 120.
